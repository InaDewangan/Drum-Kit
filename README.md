# Interactive Drum Kit

This is a simple interactive drum kit webpage built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can click on the virtual drum pads to play corresponding drum sounds.

## Features

### HTML

-   **Structure:**  The HTML document provides the basic structure for the drum kit, including a heading, a container for the drum pads, and links to external CSS and JavaScript files.
-   **Semantic Elements:**  Semantic HTML5 elements like `<div>`, `<header>`, and `<footer>` are used to create a well-structured and meaningful markup.
-   **Audio Integration:** The `<audio>` tag is used to embed sound files for each drum sound effect.

### CSS

-   **Styling:**  The CSS file provides visual styling for the drum kit, including background images, fonts, colors, padding, margins, border-radius, and box-shadow effects.
-   **Layout:**  Flexbox is used to create a responsive and centered layout for the drum pads, ensuring they adapt well to different screen sizes.
-   **Hover Effects:**  CSS transitions and transforms are used to create smooth hover effects on the drum pads, providing visual feedback to the user on mouse interaction.
-   **Media Queries:**  Media queries are implemented to adjust the layout and styling of the drum kit for different screen sizes, ensuring a responsive design. 

### JavaScript

-   **Event Listeners:**  JavaScript is used to add event listeners to each drum pad element. These listeners detect click events, triggering the corresponding drum sound to play.
-   **Audio Playback:**  The `Audio` object in JavaScript is used to load and play the drum sound files associated with each pad.

## Functionality

-   Each drum pad is assigned a specific drum sound effect.

## How to Use

## Potential Improvements
